         enabling the plugin your scully.angular_livrokindle.config.ts
         file. For your convenience, we loaded the Puppeteer plugin for you.

             import '@scullyio/scully-plugin-puppeteer';
          to your scully.angular_livrokindle.config.ts file.

          When you get this warning while not using scully-plugin-puppeteer

          The defaultRouteRenderer is now set to 'routeRenderer'.
